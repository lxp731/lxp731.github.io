- With great power comes great responsibility.

> 本叔叔最经典的一句台词，也是蜘蛛侠精神的核心。

- 我知道这段时间你过得很糟糕，但是我觉得你应该好好享受今天。

> 这是奥斯本的台词，奥斯本欣赏彼得，将他作为干儿子对待，这是在彼得失去本叔叔后彼得开学时奥斯本对彼得讲的话。

- 天哪，外面可真乱，我得用棍子揍一个老太太才能买得到酱汁。

> 这是彼得在自己生日那天开玩笑说的话。

- When you look in her eyes and she's looking back in yours, everything feels not quite normal. Because you feel stronger, and weaker at the same time. You feel excited, and the same time, terrified. The truth is, you don't know what you feel, except you know you know what kind of man you want to be. It's as if you've reached the unreachable, and you werent't ready for it.

当你看着她的双眼，而她也注视着你，一切都感觉很不平凡。你感觉自己变得更加强壮，但同时也变得更加软弱；你会感觉到很兴奋，但同时也感觉到恐惧。你也不清楚那究竟是什么感觉，只知道你想成为什么样的人，就像是完成了遥不可及的梦，却还没有准备好。

当你注视着她，她也回望着你，此刻一切都显得不同寻常。你会感到自己强大也渺小，激动也惊恐。事实上你并不知道自己的感受到底是什么，只知道自己想要成为什么样的人。就好似你还未准备好，就已经抵达未竟之地。--- 李雨濛版

> 这是彼得向玛丽简告白的话，只不过当时借蜘蛛侠做了跳板。

- The power of the sun, in the plam of my hand.

> 章鱼博士的台词，只不过他失败了，在之后的《英雄无归》的剧情里对这句台词进行了call back。想必章鱼博士此时肯定释怀了吧。

- “You shouldn't be there.”  
“I know you think we can't be together, but can't you respect me enough to let me make my own decision? I know there'll be risks, but I want to face them with you. It's wrong that we should only be half-alive, half of ourselves. I love you. So here I am, standing in your doorway. I've always been standing in your doorway. Isn't it about time somebody saved your life? ”

> 玛丽简逃婚站在彼得的门口。

- Didn't want to run into something with nothing to count on but love. A man has to be understanding and put his wife before himself.

> 梅姨对彼得讲的她自己对婚姻的理解，很现实。

- “I don't think it's for us to say whether a person deserves to live or die."   
"Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben."    
"Uncle Ben meant the world to us. But he wouldn't want us living one second with revenge in our hearts. It's like a posion. It can take you over. Before you know it, turn us into something ugly."

> 彼得黑化后杀死沙人后和梅姨的对话。

- Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice. It's the choice that make us who we are, and we can always choose to do what's right.  

无论什么挡在我们面前，无论我们内心斗争多激烈，我们总要做出选择。是选择决定了我们成为什么样的人，我们总是能选择去做正确的事情。

> 《蜘蛛侠3》最后的结束语。
